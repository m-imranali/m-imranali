- 👋 Hi, I’m @m-imranali
- 👀 I’m a Python developer at heart, working on both frontend and backend.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Resturant/Shop POS & ERP Project that I am going to make open source. 
     The Idea is to help new & small businesses maintain an e-record of their sales and manage their inventory better.
     I am trying to work on more open-source projects, and hopefully I will be able to take more time out for them.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email : m.imranali@live.com
